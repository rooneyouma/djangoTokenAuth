# Django REST API with Token Authentication

This repository demonstrates a complete Django REST API with token authentication. The project uses Django REST Framework (DRF) to handle API endpoints and token-based authentication, while also providing traditional HTML forms for user signup and login. After signing up and logging in, users receive an authentication token that can be used to access protected endpoints.

## Features

- **User Registration (Signup):**  
  A custom signup form to register new users. An authentication token upon user creation.

- **User Login:**  
  A login form that authenticates users.

- **Token Authentication:**  
  Integration with DRF's Token model to secure API endpoints.

- **Protected Endpoints:**  
  Views that require a valid token or a logged-in session to access.



## Technologies Used

- Django (version 5.1.5)
- Django REST Framework
- DRF Token Authentication
